The code sample is the backend (API) that powers the CarriGo project. 
CariGo is a decentralized Logistics application that is poised to positively disrupt the organized way of way-billing items between two locations. 
CariGo connects people who want to send packages to travelers/Carriers.
Here, the traveler is typically going to the said location and thus would make passive income while helping to move the item to the said location in record time.

I am especially excited about the project because it addresses a problem that I have faced so many times in my country Nigeria




Coming from a non-technical background, breaking into tech was never easy, I've had to teach myself almost everything I know. I took several courses online after which I started getting my hands dirty, building projects, and improving my skills, but most of the time, I did all of this alone as a solo engineer. 
That said, I would love to become an MLH fellow to gain more experience working with a team and to learn more about how a real software development team works. 

Furthermore, in my country Nigeria, there are not a lot of tech companies that employ junior engineers, so open source has always been an excellent way for me to contribute to great projects and improve my software skills.
This has instilled in me a strong passion for free and open software. In the past, I have contributed to projects such as Pysa and SAPP (by Meta), Django-rest-framework, and my communities facebook developers circle's repo which is also an open-source project. 
I would love to use this opportunity (MLH Fellowship) to ride on my already existing passion for open source, learn more about open-source, and contribute to other exciting projects. 

Finally being an MLH fellow would denitely improve my skills, signicantly boost my portfolio and make me more marketable. Hence I would be able to secure a job easily afterward. 

Thanks
